But applying makeup wasn’t only about finding the right shade, but also about helping to improve her self-esteem. Choi continued to experiment with the power of makeup and to what she calls hobby or side jobs working as a makeup artist at Hard Candy and M.A.C. Cosmetics throughout college.</p>

				<p class="articleContentRight floatForAd">After graduation, she realized her side passion could become a career enhancing women&rsquo;s natural beauty. She worked nearly eight years at M.A.C., with the later time spent on the industry side at M.A.C. PRO, a division of the beauty company that works with people in the industry. From there, she went to Bare Escentuals, working her way up to designer of makeup artistry and national makeup artist, which allowed her to travel across the country giving women makeovers and teaching them about applying makeup. Choi wanted to take her career to the next level, so she took her years of artistry, education, business acumen and sharing and launched her eponymous cosmetics line of BB creams, brushes, eye shadows and lip glosses.</p>
