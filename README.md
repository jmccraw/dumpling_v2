===========

Redesign of the Dumpling Magazine website. This is publically available for looky-loos because I learned to develop websites by looking at code. ... And because going private costs money.

This is the code that will power http://dumplingmag.com in the future. The current site is embarassing and was developed in a now-or-never kind of way that's lingered for too long.
